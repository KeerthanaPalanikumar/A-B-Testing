# A/B TESTING

In A/B testing, analyzed the results of two marketing strategies to choose the best one for future marketing campaigns.
For example, when I started an ad campaign on Instagram to promote my Instagram post for the very first time, my target audience was different from the target audience of my
second ad campaign.
After analyzing the results of both ad campaigns, I always preferred the audience of the second ad campaign as it gave better reach and followers than the first one.
